# What is GraphQL Schema?

-   A GraphQL schema is a fundamental concept in GraphQL.
-   It defines the structure of the data that clients can query and the operations they can perform. A schema in GraphQL typically consists of two main parts: typeDefs and resolvers.

# What are TypeDefs? (or Type Definitions)

-   Type definitions define the shape of the data available in the GraphQL API. They specify the types of objects that can be queried and the relationships between them.

# What are Resolvers?

-   Resolvers are functions that determine how to fetch the data associated with each field in the schema.
